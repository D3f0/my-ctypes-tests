My Self Teaching Ctypes Tests
=============================

This is a bunch of C files, its Makefile and some python
code to load them. The aim of this code is to show me how
to deal with complex structures using ctypes.

I've tried to wrap an existing lib, but all I've go is
segfaults. So I decided to switch to a bottom-up approach.
